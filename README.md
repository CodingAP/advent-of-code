These are all my solutions for the years of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) as well as a frontend for seeing my writeups and visualizations.

### Note for AOC moderators
The automated requests are served from `aoc.js`, where they have the a User-Agent header that points to this page. Nothing is done automatically, all done by a function call by the built in command line tool or a call from another script. Also, there are no inputs stored on the GitHub repository
