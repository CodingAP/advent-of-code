# Advent of Code

These are all my solutions for the years of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

### Dependencies

You will need...
* Node.js

### Installing

Clone this repository on your computer and run...
```> npm i```

To use the ```aoc.js``` file, you need a ```settings.json``` that has your tokens...

Example:
```
{
    "currentProfile": "profile1",
    "tokens": {
        "profile1": "TOKEN_HERE",
        "profile2": "TOKEN_HERE",
        "profile3": "TOKEN_HERE"
    }
}
```

### Executing the solutions
Use the provided ```aoc.js```. That will automatically run the files given.

### Other information
In this repo, there are two profiles; ```github``` and ```google```. ```github``` is my original profile where most of my code before 2022 was written. ```google``` is my new profile where I will make my push for 400 stars. You can say that there will be a difference of expertise in the code, so you can check that out if you want! Each year should have all the results if complete
