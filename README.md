# Advent of Code

These are all my solutions for the years of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

### Dependencies

You will need...
* Node.js

### Installing

Clone this repository on your computer and run...
```
> npm i
```

To use the `aoc.js` file, you need a `settings.json` that has your tokens...

Example:
```
{
    "currentProfile": "profile1",
    "tokens": {
        "profile1": "TOKEN_HERE",
        "profile2": "TOKEN_HERE",
        "profile3": "TOKEN_HERE"
    }
}
```

### Executing the solutions
Use the provided `aoc.js`. That will automatically run the files given.

### Other information
In this repo, there are two profiles; `github` and `google`. `github` is my original profile where most of my code before 2022 was written. `google` is my new profile where I will make my push for 400 stars. You can say that there will be a difference of expertise in the code, so you can check that out if you want! Each year should have all the results if complete, and each day should have a write up. Right now, I am working on `github` as I want my main solutions to be on that profile.
NEW NOTE: I am no longer using `google` as I am just updating my solutions in `github`

### Note for AOC moderators
The automated requests are served from `aoc.js`, where they have the a User-Agent header that points to this page. Nothing is done automatically, all done by a function call by the built in command line tool or a call from another script. Also, all inputs have been wiped from the project. They are still there in the past because I didn't know that storing inputs was discouraged by Eric. Other than that, all the other stuff is visible to the public.
