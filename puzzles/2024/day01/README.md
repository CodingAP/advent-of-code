Hello all! Today is the first day of Advent of Code 2024, and it wasn't bad! Last year's part 1 was leagues harder than today, so I got some stuff done. In this puzzle, we need to compare two sets of number lists. In part 1, we need to sort each list and add the distances between each value. In part 2, we need to add the "similarity scores" of each number in the left list. This is calculated with `num * occurence of num in right list`. Overall, it wasn't a bad day, it just took two tries to correctly read the prose. Next time I will try to do better!
