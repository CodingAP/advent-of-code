# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 1: [Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
By Alex Prosser

Leaderboard: 148 (Part 1) / 341 (Part 2)

Welcome to Advent of Code 2022! This is exciting as I will be trying to compete for the global leaderboard for once. After doing this for 3 years, I feel like I am ready to compete. This first day's puzzle is very simple, as we just need to find the biggest group of numbers. The format is this...

```
1000
2000
3000

4000
5000
```

I did this by splitting each group up with `\n\n` and adding them. Using JavaScripts array methods makes this super easy and fast. Part 2 did give me a hiccup as I didn't find multiple maxes, so I had to slightly rewrite to code to work. This involves adding up all the numbers and sorting them. Still, I am happy with my position as it is my highest on the leaderboard ever.
