# Advent of Code 2015 - Day 3: [Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/3)
By Alex Prosser

This puzzle consists of a sled dropping off presents in a 2D grid which is controlled by the input. The input has 4 different characters, and each character moves the sled whether it is controlled by Santa or the robot in part 2. `<` goes to the left (`x--`), `>` goes to the right (`x++`), `v` goes down (`y--`), and `^` goes up (`y++`). For the first part, there is only one sled and it delivers a present every instruction. One note is that there should be a present already at `(0,0)`. Some inputs already cross `(0,0)`, but for it to be completely accurate for any input, it should account for that. The second part uses two sleds to deliver presents, and it alternates who does the delivery. I stored the houses in an object as it allows for infinite sized grids and easy access to the information. I just use a location key formated like `[x],[y]` and create a location when needed and increment when a sled is at that location. It also makes it easy to see how many houses have presents because it can just be the size of the houses object.
