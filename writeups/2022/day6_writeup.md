In terms of lines of code, this is the smallest so far. In this puzzle, we need to find certain amount of consectutive characters that all are different. In part 1, we need to find 4 characters. In part 2, we need to find 14 characters. To do this, we can just create a Set object and see if it is the same size of the substring. Not much of a write up.
